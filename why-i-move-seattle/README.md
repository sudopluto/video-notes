- why did i move from boston to seattle?
- job
    - hate remote work
    - wanted to work in person
    - many benefits being close to main campus
        - perks
        - events
        - coworker socializing
- money
    - washington = no income tax
        - easy to save money if minimize spend
    - job provided relocation bonus
- life / adventure
    - much better nature close by
        - rei and columbia headquarters nearby
    - lived in boston for 5 years now, felt like moving on and exploring
    - wanted to practice social skills again, make new friends as practice
- pros
    - milder winters
    - more of a tech scene
    - adventure close by
    - vancouver and portland are awesome
    - bigger car scene
    - friends ended up moving out of boston anyways, excuse to visit
    - cheaper cost of living
    - better food & coffee
- cons
    - need to remake friend group from scratch
    - tech scene can feel boring
    - less vibey than boston (arch, people, events)
    - more isolated, less day trips
    - gray is gray, london type of cold rather than snow
- overall?
    - happy i made the leap, but unsure if i want to stay long term
