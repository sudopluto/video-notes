- before we start:
    - talk to your coworkers, they know the company and their benefits better than me
    - get in a habit on reading up on:
        - irs stuff like tax changes (brackets, rates, ira / 401k limits, etc)
        - benefits your company offers: espp, 401k, HSA / FSA, etc
    - don't waste time / sweat the small stuff
        - focus on principles and reducing taxes & fees
    - don't be scared of making new accounts
    - don't be scared of making a sub-optimal choice
        - always time to fix
        - something done imperfectly is better than nothing done at all
    - read the fine print, do your own reading
        - fine print, especially when it comes to fees
        - investopedia, nerdwallet, reddit personalfinance

- ok, now we are getting a bit technical
    - two main principles:
        - compounding
        - taxes

- compounding: neutral, can be good or bad
    - bad:
        - inflation 
        - debt interest (credit card, loan, etc)
    - good:
        - investment intrest (savings acct, reinvesting dividends)
        - health, knowlege, friends

- your job: make sure the "good" is growing faster than the "bad"
    - protecting against inflation by investing
    - reducing amount of taxes owed by using credits, reducing taxable events like selling of shares,
    using the right retirement accounts, etc

- step 0: cut living expenses
    - https://www.businessinsider.com/how-americans-spend-most-of-their-money-2017-1?r=US&IR=T
    - have roommates, live at home, don't own a car
    - cook own meals, mix your own drinks at home
    - use an app like mint or marcus to track spending
        - i use marcus: https://www.marcus.com/us/en
    - shouldn't be painful, don't overdo it. think reducing waste vs starving self.
    - you should learn the self control to use cashback credit cards
        - ex: i have a card that has zero annual fee and has 3% back at restaurants & groceries
        - free money for good organization and self control
        - keep enough in checking to cover bills, and set up auto bill payment for cards
        - you need to start building credit asap, you'll need it for auto and home loans,
        as well as good credit cards
        - credit cards offer better protection than debit cards:
            - fraud
            - extended warrenties
            - no fees for when traveling abroad (depends on card)

- step 1: save
    - don't keep all your money in a checking acct ffs
    - savings rates are trash rn, but better than nothing
    - what to save for?
        - emergency money (large cc bill, medical stuff, emergency hotel, you name it)
            - proportial to your living expenses / risk factors
        - future car / housing deposits / loan + cc payments / trips
        - future education, more stuff for side hustle
        - for maxing out tax-advantaged accts like iras
    - DONT OVER DO IT
        - oversaving isn't going to reduce risk, actually exposes you to risk
            - remember inflation and taxes are eating away at your money
        - consider spreading savings across the less risky investments classes instead of all in savings acct
            - bonds, broad index funds, crypto savings accts

- step 2: taxes
    - if you are on an internship, because of tax withholding, government is getting a interest free loan from you
    - tax withholding is deducted from your paycheck as if you are working there for a full year
    - file your taxes asap to get your refund asap
        - shouldn't cost money to file taxes, should be free for your income level
            - https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile/browse-all-offers/
            - i use taxact btw
    - tell your parents not to claim you as a dependent
    - you'll probably get emails from employer / banks / brokerages / schools with tax forms
    - once you get all relevant forms, just plug them into the software
    - credit vs deduction, coupon example
        - https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/tax-credit-vs-tax-deduction
        - credit: think of it a hard value coupon: $10 off
            - once tax is calculated, reduces amount you have to pay
        - deduction: think of it as a percent off coupon: take 10% off
            - reduces the income that the tax is then applied to
    - standard deductable is probably fine, no need to itemize
    - two credits worth thinking about
        - contributed to retirement account (don't worry, next step)
            - https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc610
        - bought some textbooks / a new laptop / paid for part of tuition?

            - https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/education-credits-questions-and-answers
    - DONT STRESS TOO MUCH
        - let tax software guide you
        - google if you are confused

- step 3: retirement
    - before we start: DON'T BE SCARED OF MAKING ACCOUNTS
        - you want to change brokerages, thats fine. you can transfer shares easy peasy
        - the only cost is remebering a new login
    - your tax bracket is on the low-end right now
    - probably paying the least amount of taxes percentage wise in your life right now
        - take advantage of that with a roth ira
    - roth ira: post-tax retirement account.
        - you put in up to $6000 a year of post-tax (aka money from your paycheck), and then when you reach retirement age,
        you can take out the money tax free!!!!
            - so what you ask?
            - money is allowed to compound freely
            - you aren't really paying much taxes right now
    - when you get a full time job that pays more, you can consider trad iras, and 401ks, but right now as an intern: roth ira
    is probably the best bet
    - i would recommend a robo advisor, they'll choose the etfs (collection of stocks / bonds) and how to allocate your money
        - would recommend schwab first, then wealthfront
            - https://www.roboadvisorpros.com/robo-advisors-with-most-aum-assets-under-management/
            - https://content.schwab.com/intelligent-portfolios/historical-performance/
            - https://intelligent.schwab.com/page/guide-to-asset-classes
        - treat it like a piggy bank, you put money in, and forget about it
    - stick to the $6000 (or whatever it is rn) limit. also in the future consider income limits
    - for roth ira, worst case, you can take money out. the penalty will be decided on how much of account value is principle (what you put in),
    vs growth (dividends, stock price increase, etc)

- step 3a: employer provided stonks
    - probably won't matter as an intern since you probably won't be able to sign up
    - let's talk 401ks
        - company provides their own retirement funds (through a manager like prudential), that you can contribute to
            - the good: most places will match your contribution up to a certain percentage!! free money!!
                - ex: if i put in 5% of my paycheck, my company might match up to 4% 1:1, meaning total now is 9% of paycheck!
            - the bad: funds are fixed, and often suboptimal
        - in general, if they have a match and you can sign up and an intern, take it, and at least contribute enough to get a match
            - it can go 401k match -> ira -> 401k, in terms of reaching your retirement contribution goals
            - when you leave company, you can roll 401k into ira, or into an 401k at your new job. or you can just keep account
    - let's talk stock options / espp
        - damn you work at a tech company?
        - it's free money, take it
            - if it's espp, put in as much as you can comfortable handle. obviously look at market and company trends to get idea of risk
            level

- still have money left over? damn you balling

- step 4: inflation protection
    - easiest way is to copy etf portfolio from your robo / 401k fund
    - not tax advantaged, you need a indiv brokerage account
        - schwab, fidelity, even robinhood
    - goal is to beat inflation
    - don't sell shares until after a year of purchase unless you want to big tax bill
        - that's if you made money, if you lose money you can sell any time
        
- step 5: fun investing
    - i call it fun because unless you go full finance, it's probably just socially acceptable gambeling
    - risky, don't put in anything you aren't willing to lose
    - easy to sink way too much time into this, probably will get better roi by focusing on your side hustle
    - crypto
        - btc and eth are big ones, probably stick to those
        - look at savings accounts where you lend stable coins for nutty apy % (gusd is 8% at time of writting)

    - stocks / options
