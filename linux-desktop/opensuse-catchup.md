- so what has opensuse been doing in the past 8+ years

- opensuse has technological advantages, unlike ubuntu
    - strong kde support
    - a TESTED rolling release distribution
    - strong support of all modern desktop linux parts
        - wayland, flatpak, libinput, pipewire, etc
    - first one to adopt btrfs, plus a really cool snapshot tool tied to pkg manager
    - open build service
        - github approach to packaging, a better version of ppas

- but opensuse has not used this time to polish, like fedora has

- opensuse papercuts
    - the patterns: installing unneeded applications
    - strong deps for "recommended packages", end up pulling in random stuff
    - weak 3rd party repo: packman doesn't even have a NA mirror
    - terrible wiki: full of outdated info
    - leap -----> fedora workstation ------> tumbleweed
        - either extreme of stability represented, no answer to fedora's sweet spot

- opensuse is so close yet so far
    - ubuntu isn't doing much to hold onto it's number 2 spot
    - most of the issues are on the community side, like packaging / documentation

- well, what are YOU going to do about it?
    - not really that invested
    - take inspiration from KDE neon and Fedora Workstation, get both a functional KDE and GNOME desktop
        - create new patterns / meta packages
    - work on the documentation, make it lead flatpak first to avoid packman (sorry) for as long as possible
    - start a papercuts project like Nate: https://pointieststick.com/

- why wait for me?
